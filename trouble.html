  <p>
    <!-- There is no opening ‘p’ tag to the following paragraph below. This caused a bug because the styling css page doesn’t know which element to affect.  -->
Elephants are the largest land mammals on Earth. They are highly intelligent and form
strong
family bonds led by a matriarch. They use their trunks for eating, drinking, and
communication.

There are three main species of elephants — each adapted to its own habitat:

<ul>
<li><strong>African Savannah Elephant:</strong> Found in open grasslands.</li>
<li><strong>African Forest Elephant:</strong> Smaller, lives in dense forests.</li>
<li><strong>Asian Elephant:</strong> Found across South and Southeast Asia.</li>
</li>
</ul>
  <!-- There was no ending <ul> tag which caused a bug where the list didn’t know where to end. This made it so everything underneath was included in the <ul> tag. -->
